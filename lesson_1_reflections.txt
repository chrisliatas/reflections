How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

I could easily compare the lines that were different having them side-by-side.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

By spending less time dealing with trivial issues and worrying about losing code or
changes gone wrong, ideas not pursued.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: choose the right logical point.
Cons: maybe forget to commit at the right point

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because files might be affecting one another.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

First you get the history log and the respective commit identities and then you
can dig deeper with the difference between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

One can have peace of mind knowing that whatever goes wrong can revert to a previous
stable version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

For an actual project
