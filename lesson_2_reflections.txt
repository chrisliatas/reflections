What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git starts tracking by adding some hidden files under ".git" directory in the directory it has been initialized.
We initialize the repo to start writing history of the changes.

(git init)

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediate level between the repository and the working directory allowing more control
over the files we want to be tracked by git.

(git commit)
(git commit -m "Commit message")
