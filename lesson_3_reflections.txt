GitHub

(git remote) -> Show remotes connected
(git remote add "new remote local name" url) -> create new remote repo connection eg. "origin"
(git remote -v) -> Show remotes info verbose
(git push "remote to send info" "branch to send")

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to colaborate with others, share your work/thoughts, or distribute your work.

(git pull "remote to send info" "branch to send") -> eg. git pull origin master

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you might want to check what git will pull from the remote. Someone else might have changed the file on the remote and you might
not want to pull that change locally.
