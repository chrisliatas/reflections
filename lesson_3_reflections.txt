GitHub

(git remote) -> Show remotes connected
(git remote add "new remote local name" url) -> create new remote repo connection eg. "origin"
(git remote -v) -> Show remotes info verbose
(git push "remote to send info" "branch to send")

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to colaborate with others, share your work/thoughts, or distribute your work.
